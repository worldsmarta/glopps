partNumber:	The Part ID entered by the user.
prefix:	Part prefix (can be auto-filled if only one available).
marketOptions:	List of available market consumers for dropdown.
selectedMarketConsumer:	Currently selected market consumer from dropdown

useEffect(() => {

Start an effect that will run after the component renders (i.e., after React paints the DOM).
You use this to measure real DOM sizes — measuring before the DOM exists or is painted would be wrong.

if (nameRef.current) {
nameRef is a useRef that should point to the DOM element that displays the consumer name.
nameRef.current will be null until that element is mounted. This check prevents errors when it’s not present.

setIsNameTruncated(nameRef.current.scrollWidth > nameRef.current.clientWidth);

nameRef.current.scrollWidth
→ the width of the element’s content (including content that overflows / is not visible). It includes padding, and counts the full width needed to display the text.
nameRef.current.clientWidth
→ the visible inner width of the element (includes padding, excludes borders, margins and the vertical scrollbar).
scrollWidth > clientWidth
→ means the content is wider than the visible area → text is overflowing / being truncated (usually shown with text-overflow: ellipsis).

setIsNameTruncated(...) stores the boolean result (true or false) in state so your JSX can show a title tooltip only when needed.

}

End of the nameRef block.

if (designationRef.current) {
Same pattern for the designation element: check ref exists.

setIsDesignationTruncated(designationRef.current.scrollWidth > designationRef.current.clientWidth);
Same comparison for designation; stores result in isDesignationTruncated.

}
End of designation block.

}, [marketConsumerDetails]);

Dependency array: this effect runs whenever marketConsumerDetails changes.
That’s appropriate because the displayed name/designation text changes when a new market consumer is selected, so you need to re-check overflow then.


Auto-fill prefix case
Example 1 — Prefix not entered
User input:
Part ID: "FA-311" Prefix: (empty)
Data says: availablePrefixes = ["CH"]
Since:
currentPrefix = "" → empty
availablePrefixes.length = 1 → only one
Result:currentPrefix = "CH", prefix state gets updated to "CH" → now your prefix box shows CH automatically.

Example 2 — Prefix entered
User input:
Part ID: "FA-311" Prefix: "CH"
Data says: availablePrefixes = ["CH"]
Since:
currentPrefix = "CH" not empty
First condition !currentPrefix is falseResult: Auto-fill does not run, because you already typed the prefix.


-> added tab key navigation as well
